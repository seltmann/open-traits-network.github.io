Katja is an entomologist, data scientist and media artist based in Santa Barbara, California, United States. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy investigating interactions between organisms, especially insects. I direct the UCSB Natural History Collections and our biotic interaction data is available through GloBI (https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org). We also include other trait data with our specimens through images or in the shared Darwin Core Archive.

I can offer expertise in natural history collections, entomology and ontology. I am interested in connecting with others who want to share museum specimen trait data and I am happy to help connect people through organized symposia, our Open Traits website, and posters/presentations at meetings.
